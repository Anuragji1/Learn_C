What will be the output of this code, if the a = 5 and b = 9 based on user input?

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int a, b;
  scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
  printf("%d%d%d", a, b, a + b); 

  return 0;
}
SOL.:-
Correct Answer:

5914
Explanation:
a = 5, b = 9 and a + b = 14. 
Since no 'space' or next line definition has been defined in the cout, 
our output becomes 5914.

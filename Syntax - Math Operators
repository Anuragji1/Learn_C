Let us now look at some of the nuts and bolts of C. In particular, the top 3 lines and the bottom 2 lines that we are adding in all of our codes. What do they do?

C uses several predefined functions to do specific tasks like taking specific inputs and outputs.

Line 1: #include adds a 'header file' to your code.
Header files contain various predefined functions that you can use in your code.
Don't worry if you don't understand how #include works. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.
Line 2: A blank line. C ignores white space.
We use it to make the code more readable.
Line 3: Another thing that always appears in a C program, is int main().
This is called a function.
Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
If there are multiple functions, this is the function which is executed first.
Line 5: "printf()" - We've already seen what this does.
Line 7: "return 0" ends the main function.
Line 8: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket "}" to actually end the main function.
Try displaying the sum of 12 & 7 using the given code

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    printf("%d", 12+7);
    
    return 0;
}

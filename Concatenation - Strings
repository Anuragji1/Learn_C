Statement :- 
The strcat() function defined in the string.h library can be used to add strings together to make a new string.
This is called concatenation.
For eg -

char x[] = "Good"; 
char y[] = "Work";
strcat(x,y);
printf("%s", x);
// output will be: GoodWork
Note: You can add spaces between words by using strcat() repeatedly.
For eg -

char x[] = "Good"; 
char y[] = "Work";
strcat(strcat(x," "),y);
printf("%s", x);
// output will be: Good Work
Task
Write a program which does the following

Declare two variables x and y
Assign the values "Hello" to variable x and "World" to variable y.
Output x and y to the console. Don't forget to add a space in between them.
My output will be Hello World.

Sol.:- 
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    char x[] = "Hello";
    char y[] = "World";
    
    strcat(strcat(x," "),y);
    printf("%s", x,y);
    
    return 0;
}

We can access the characters in a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets [].
We use the concept of indexing which means every character in a string corresponds to a number called the index number

               0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  - index number
     for eg - "C o d e C h e f"
Note

Indexing always starts from 
0
0 when going left to right.
So the first character of a string s is s[0], the second is s[1], and so on.
Task
Write a program which does the following

Create a string variable word and assign the text "Programming" to it
Print the characters o and r from the string word in separate lines using the syntax defined above

Sol.:- 
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    char word[] = "Programming";
    printf("%c\n%c", word[2], word[4]);
    
    return 0;
}

//We can add as many printf() statements as we want.
Write a program which does the following

Output: 3 + 4
Output: 2 + 1.
Use the printf syntax we learned in last problem. Note - Notice that in the output they are printed together without any space between them.

Sol.:-

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("%d", 3+4);
    printf("%d", 2+1);
    
    return 0;
}

Strings are used for storing text.
A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes.
Strings are implemented as char arrays in C.
For example:

 char name[] = "Chef";
Task
Write a program which does the following

Create a string named fruit and assign the value "Apple" to it. 
Output fruit to the console.

Sol.:-
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    char fruit[] = "Apple";
    
    printf("%s", fruit);
    
    return 0;
}

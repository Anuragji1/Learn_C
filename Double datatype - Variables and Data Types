Statement :- If we want to introduce decimal values we use the double keyword before declaring the variable.

Task:- 
Write a program which does the following:

Find the area of a circle whose radius is 8.9 cm. Take pi = 3.14.
Declare variables radius, pi and area and assign the relevant values to them.
Note: Area of a circle is Pi * radius^2
Make sure to use the appropriate format specifier in printf() for double which is "%f"
Sol.:- 

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    double radius = 8.9;
 double pi = 3.14;     // radius has to be declared as a 'double'
    double area = pi * radius * radius ;
    
    printf("The Area of the given Circle is %f", area);
    return 0;
}

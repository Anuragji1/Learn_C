Note :- If we want any other text in between the outputs we can provide that text inside " " of printf().
Statement:-
Task
Write a program which does the following

Output the result of 3 + 4
Output the result of 2 + 1 on the same line
Insert the text "and" between the outputs.
Note: We have a space before and after the text as well, as without those, the output would be "7and3", instead of "7 and 3".

Sol.:-

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    printf("%d and %d", 3+4, 2+1);
    
    return 0;
}
